## Business Logic Details

### Rental Calculation Algorithm

```typescript
1. Parse pickup and return date/times
2. For each day between pickup and return:
   a. Skip if Sunday
   b. Check pickup day:
      - Before 12pm? Count it
      - After 12pm? Skip it
   c. Check return day:
      - Before 12pm? Skip it
      - After 12pm? Count it
3. Calculate: days × daily_rate
4. Determine refund or additional payment
```
